# hey !!!! important to read this, kinda..
this is my rng game (obviously..)  
so what can you DO?
roll, find ranks, progress.. etc..
as of now, theres 100+ ranks to discover!?! (updates every 3 days or so)
wait, is that..
**ONE HUNDRED RANKS?**
yes thats RIGHT, theres over ONE HUNDRED, such as secrets ranging from a few thousand, to a **QUINTILLION**?
have fun and good luck completionists..
**youll need it. a lot. trust me**
the EASIEST secret is 1/4040.404, whilst the HARDEST is 1/1e18..
the easiest normal rank is 1/1, and the hardest is..
*ONE NONILLION. (1x10^30)*
## how to play
- press roll, click ranks to accept them..
- autoroll BASE accept is for NONVARIANTED stuff, just a FYI..
- unlock features and progress..
